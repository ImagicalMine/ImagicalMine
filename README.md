## What is this?

ImagicalMine is software for hosting Minecraft : Pocket Edition servers. From controlling everything you can possibly do on MCPE to everything players can ever imagine on a server, ImagicalMine is the perfect solution to hosting large-scale MCPE servers. Our goal is to make ImagicalMine the best MCPE server software out there, and can implement the latest features from the singleplayer MCPE version.

## Why is the Imagical Corporation/ImagicalMine team doing this?

Because @shoghicp of the PocketMine team has given us so much, we've decided to build onto the project and help out the community. Thanks to all the team members of the Imagical Corporation, the work you are seeing today is open-source and free for every human to use. It will stay free forever and the team will try and keep it active as well as possible.

## Can I extend ImagicalMine to my own needs?

Sure you can! Check out [API Documentation](https://github.com/ImagicalMine/ImagicalMine/wiki/Plugins) to start making plugins to transform your server into something you never thought you'd be able to even do!
